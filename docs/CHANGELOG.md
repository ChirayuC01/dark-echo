## [Unreleased] — Phase 8 pending

---

## [v0.12.0] — 2026-06-16 — Phase 7

### Added
- **Sentry enemy**: stationary guard with rotating visual scan cone
  - `Sentry` class in `entities.js`: state machine `idle`/`alert`/`stunned`
  - Scan cone: 90° arc (±45°), 180px range, rotates at 60°/s
  - Detection: player must be inside cone AND have clear line-of-sight (castFn ray check)
  - On spot: 8-second pursuit at `CHASER_SPEED_HUNT = 80 px/s`
  - Pulse hit: stuns 0.6s (same as PatrolEnemy)
  - 4 new constants: `SENTRY_SCAN_RANGE`, `SENTRY_SCAN_ARC`, `SENTRY_SCAN_SPEED`, `SENTRY_HUNT_DURATION`
  - `playSentryAlert()` already present in `audio.js` from Phase 0
- **Sentry cone rendered** in `drawEnemies()`: faint orange arc in idle, bright red in alert; drawn behind enemy dot; `e.scanRange` field acts as Sentry discriminator in renderer
- Level 9 "The Corridor" now has sentry at row 13 col 12 guarding the exit sprint

### Changed
- **Trigger visual** — now much more noticeable:
  - Larger outer glow (28px radius, was 16px)
  - More dramatic pulse beat (0.35–0.80 amplitude swing, was 0.50–0.75)
  - Pulsing outer ring stroke
  - Slow-rotating 4-spoke cross indicator distinguishes it from key/exit/door dots
  - Brighter center dot (4.5px, was 3px)

---

## [v0.11.0] — 2026-06-16 — Phase 6

### Added
- **Switches / triggers mechanic**: one-shot floor trigger zones revealed by sound
  - `G.triggers[]` array in game state; populated from `def.triggers[]` level def field
  - Trigger format: `{ col, row, action, targetId }` — action is `'open_door'` or `'remove_wall'`
  - Triggers revealed by ray proximity (same 28px `REVEAL_D` threshold as exit/key/door)
  - Player walks within 10px of trigger center → fires exactly once; `fired = true` prevents re-trigger
  - `'open_door'`: opens the door with matching `targetId` (same logic as key pickup)
  - `'remove_wall'`: clears `G.grid[row][col]` at the `"row,col"` coordinate in `targetId`
  - `drawTriggers()` in `renderer.js`: bright blue-white `rgba(100,160,255)` pulsing radial dot; disappears on fire; `sin(now/350)` pulse distinguishes from keys (400ms) and exit (500ms)
- Level 9 "The Corridor" extended with trigger puzzle:
  - Wall at row 13 col 16 blocks direct path to exit
  - Trigger at row 9 col 3 removes it — fires naturally as player walks left toward corridor 3 entry
  - Hint updated: "A switch unlocks the exit · Watch for the crusher · Wait, then dash"

---

## [v0.10.0] — 2026-06-12 — Phase 5

### Added
- **Doors & keys mechanic**: hidden collectibles that unlock blocked passages
  - `KEY_PICKUP_RADIUS = 12` in `constants.js`
  - `G.doors: Map<id, {col, row, x, y, open, revealedAt}>` — closed doors are written into the mutable grid as `CELL.WALL`; opening restores `CELL.EMPTY`
  - `G.keys: Map<id, {col, row, x, y, collected, doorId, revealedAt}>` — player walks within 12px to collect
  - `G.doorsByCell: Map<"row,col", door>` — fast lookup to identify which wall hits are doors
  - Key pickup: `Audio.playKeyPickup()` + matching door opens instantly + `Audio.playDoorOpen()`
  - Doors and keys revealed by ray proximity (same 28px threshold as exit)
  - Door impact glints render amber `rgba(210,160,50)` — distinct from regular wall glints
  - `drawDoors()` in `renderer.js`: amber fill+stroke locked; faint green open; hearing-attenuated
  - `drawKeys()` in `renderer.js`: gold `rgba(255,210,80)` pulsing radial gradient dot
- Level 8 "The Collapse" redesigned with key/door chokepoint:
  - Row 9 all-walls except col 9 (door) — only passage from middle zone to lower section
  - Key at col 16, row 3 (upper section; near chaser at col 14)
  - Door unlocks when key collected; lower section then accessible
  - Simplified lower section: wide open rows 10 + 12, col 18 corridor to exit col 18 row 13

---

## [v0.9.0] — 2026-06-12 — Phase 4

### Added
- **Crusher mechanic**: moving lethal wall segments
  - `Crusher` class in `entities.js`: sinusoidal `h`/`v` axis motion, TILE-sized AABB
  - Random start phase per crusher — avoids synchronized movement on level load
  - `castRayCrushers()` in `collision.js`: AABB slab-method ray intersection, returns closest crusher hit
  - `circleOverlapsAABB()` in `collision.js`: player vs crusher kill check
  - `castFn` now composites grid DDA and crusher slab results, returns closest hit
  - Crushers revealed by ray proximity (`processRayEntities`) and direct ray bounce (`applyWallHits`)
  - Crusher kill: `circleOverlapsAABB` overlap → `die('Crushed.')`
  - Crusher impacts render in orange (same palette as hazard) via `cellType: 'crusher'` on impact objects
  - `drawCrushers()` in `renderer.js`: orange filled+stroked block, hearing-attenuated, glow
- Level 9 "The Corridor" — 3 corridors (rows 3, 5, 7), one crusher each (5.0s / 3.5s / 2.5s period), S-shaped path to exit

---

## [v0.8.0] — 2026-06-12 — Phase 3

### Added
- **Collapsible wall mechanic**: `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE = 4` tiles block rays and movement like walls
  - Destroyed by a direct pulse ray hit with energy > `COLLAPSE_ENERGY_THRESHOLD (0.3)`
  - Permanent: `G.grid[row][col]` mutated to `CELL.EMPTY`; path stays open for the rest of the level
  - Collapse emits a 12-ray glint burst at hit point (`COLLAPSE_BURST_RAYS = 12`, 80px maxDist)
  - Collapse audio: `playCollapse()` — low rumble + noise burst
  - Step rays and hazard rays cannot trigger collapse (energy too low after bounces)
- Collapsible wall glints render as warm tan `rgba(200,175,120,α)` — distinct from white-blue wall glints
- `collision.js` `castRay` and `resolveWalls` now treat `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE` as solid (same as `CELL.WALL`)
- `applyWallHits()` stores `cellType: 'collapsible'` on impact objects for renderer coloring
- Level 8 "The Collapse" — two horizontal barriers at rows 6 and 8 (single collapsible gap each at col 9); patrol in middle zone; chaser in upper section

---

## [v0.7.0] — 2026-06-11 — Phase 2

### Added
- **Water zone mechanic**: `CELL.WATER = 5` tiles affect player movement and step sound
  - Speed: 60% of normal (`WATER_SPEED_MULT = 0.6`), stacks multiplicatively with crouch
  - Step interval: 60% of normal (`WATER_INTERVAL_MULT = 0.6`) — more frequent splashes
  - Step ray count: 160% of normal (`WATER_RAY_MULT = 1.6`) — louder, more visible splash
  - Crouch + water combined: speed = 150 × 0.45 × 0.6 = 40.5 px/s
- `Player.move()` now accepts 6th param `inWater = false`; applies `WATER_SPEED_MULT`
- `Player.inWater` field set each frame from tile under player
- `G.playerInWater` state flag in `game.js`; checked before every step burst
- `drawWaterZone()` in `renderer.js` — radial teal gradient (`rgba(50,150,160)`) at player position when on water tile
- `Audio.playFootstepWater()` called when stepping on water (replaces `playFootstep()`)
- Level 7 "Flooded" — upper maze → forced 3-row water crossing (cols 2–17) → lower maze; two hazards inside the flood zone

---

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-06-11 — Phase 1

### Added
- **Crouch / stealth mechanic**: Hold Shift or C (keyboard) or tap CROUCH button (mobile)
  - Speed: 45% of normal (`CROUCH_SPEED_MULT = 0.45`)
  - Step interval: 2.5× longer (`CROUCH_INTERVAL_MULT = 2.5`)
  - Step ray count: 50% fewer (`CROUCH_RAY_MULT = 0.5`)
  - Step ray max distance: 70% shorter (`CROUCH_DIST_MULT = 0.7`)
- `Input.isCrouching()` export
- `#crouch-btn` mobile touch button (bottom-center)
- `#crouch-indicator` HUD element — lights up when crouching
- `PatrolEnemy.stepAware` flag + `hearStep()` investigation behavior (3.5s)
- `RaySystem.burst()` optional `countOverride`/`maxDistOverride` parameters
- Level 6 "The Whisper" — introduces crouch mechanic via step-aware patrol
- `loadLevel()` now deep-copies grid (prep for Phase 3 collapsible walls)

---

  - `CROUCH_SPEED_MULT`, `CROUCH_INTERVAL_MULT`, `CROUCH_RAY_MULT`, `CROUCH_DIST_MULT`
  - `WATER_SPEED_MULT`, `WATER_INTERVAL_MULT`, `WATER_RAY_MULT`, `WATER_ENERGY_DRAIN`
  - `COLLAPSE_ENERGY_THRESHOLD`, `COLLAPSE_BURST_RAYS`

### Removed
