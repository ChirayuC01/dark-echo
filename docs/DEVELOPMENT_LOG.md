## [Phase 0 — In Progress] Cleanup & Foundation

**Date:** 2026-06-11  
**Branch:** `claude/sound-vision-game-7pvbo1`

### What was done
- Created `/docs/` directory with all 6 documentation files (this session).
- `js/constants.js` cleaned up:
  - Removed unused legacy wave constants: `STEP_WAVE_MAX`, `STEP_WAVE_SPEED`, `STEP_WAVE_ALPHA`, `PULSE_WAVE_MAX`, `PULSE_WAVE_SPEED`, `PULSE_WAVE_ALPHA`, `WAVE_RING_W`, `HAZARD_PULSE_MAX`, `HAZARD_PULSE_SPEED`
  - Added new cell type constants: `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE = 4`, `CELL.WATER = 5`
  - Added crouch mechanic constants: `CROUCH_SPEED_MULT`, `CROUCH_INTERVAL_MULT`, `CROUCH_RAY_MULT`, `CROUCH_DIST_MULT`
  - Added water zone constants: `WATER_SPEED_MULT`, `WATER_INTERVAL_MULT`, `WATER_RAY_MULT`, `WATER_ENERGY_DRAIN`
  - Added collapse constants: `COLLAPSE_ENERGY_THRESHOLD`, `COLLAPSE_BURST_RAYS`
  - Added `ECHO_TRAIL_CAP = 500`

### Pending (still in Phase 0)
- `audio.js` SOUND_CONFIG — not yet added
- `waves.js` ECHO_TRAIL_CAP enforcement — not yet added
- Final commit + push

## [Pre-Phase 0] Prototype Complete (Prior Session)

**Date:** ~2026-06-10  
**Branch:** `claude/sound-vision-game-7pvbo1`

### What was built
Full working prototype from scratch:
- `index.html` — game shell, canvas, 5 overlay screens, HUD, touch controls
- `css/style.css` — responsive layout, 800×600 centered, mobile scaling
- `js/constants.js` — all game parameters
- `js/utils.js` — dist, normalize, clamp, lerp, tileCenter, segPtDist
- `js/audio.js` — Web Audio procedural synthesis (6 sound functions)
- `js/input.js` — keyboard (WASD/arrows/Space/Esc/P) + touch joystick
- `js/entities.js` — Player, PatrolEnemy, ChaserEnemy, Hazard
- `js/waves.js` — Ray class (DDA), RaySystem (burst, update, pool, echoTrails)
- `js/collision.js` — castRay (DDA grid traversal), resolveWalls, circlesOverlap
- `js/levels.js` — 5 hand-crafted levels (20×15 grids)
- `js/game.js` — G state machine, loadLevel, update, game loop, UI handlers
- `js/renderer.js` — draw pipeline, hearing attenuation, all visual elements
- `js/ui.js` — screen show/hide, hint/message setters

### Key design decisions made
- Replaced circular wave system with DDA ray-based propagation (physically plausible reflections)
- Walls are NEVER drawn — only ray impact glints reveal geometry
- Exit hidden until player ray passes within 28px (`revealedAt` guard)
- Ray speed slowed (340 → 160 px/s), trail persistence extended (1600 → 4200ms)
- Distance attenuation via `hearing(d)` smoothstep applied to ALL visual elements
- Per-segment distance calculation via `segPtDist` for hearing falloff

### Known issues at prototype completion
- echoTrails had no hard cap (just time-based pruning) — addressed in Phase 0
- Several legacy constants from old wave system cluttered constants.js — cleaned in Phase 0
- No crouch, water, collapsibles, crushers, doors, keys, sentries, or blind stalkers
- Only 5 of planned 10 levels
