## Phase 0 — Cleanup & Foundation
**Status:** ✅ Complete (commit `cbc1694`)  
**Goal:** Clean up legacy code, add new cell types, centralize audio config, fix echo trail memory leak.

### Tasks
- [x] Remove unused constants (`STEP_WAVE_*`, `PULSE_WAVE_*`, `WAVE_RING_W`, `HAZARD_PULSE_MAX`, `HAZARD_PULSE_SPEED`) from `constants.js`
- [x] Add `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE = 4`, `CELL.WATER = 5` to `constants.js`
- [x] Add crouch/water/collapse constants to `constants.js`
- [x] Add `ECHO_TRAIL_CAP = 500` to `constants.js`
- [ ] Add `SOUND_CONFIG` object to `audio.js`; wire all existing `play*()` to use it
- [ ] Add `ECHO_TRAIL_CAP` enforcement in `waves.js` `RaySystem.update()`
- [ ] Commit + push to `claude/sound-vision-game-7pvbo1`

### Files Modified
- `js/constants.js` ← partially done
- `js/audio.js` ← pending
- `js/waves.js` ← pending

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No console errors on any of the 5 existing levels
- [ ] `SOUND_CONFIG` exported from `audio.js`; all play functions use it
- [ ] Echo trail array never exceeds 500 entries (verify via debug overlay once built)
- [ ] No references to removed constants anywhere in codebase

## Phase 1 — Crouch / Stealth Mechanic
**Status:** ✅ Complete (commit `3933d22`)  
**Goal:** Player can hold Shift/C to move quietly with fewer, shorter rays.  
**Depends on:** Phase 0 complete

### Tasks
- [x] `input.js`: Add `isCrouching()` — returns true if Shift or C is held
- [x] `input.js`: Add mobile crouch button handling (touch element `#crouch-btn`)
- [x] `entities.js` Player: Add `crouching` field; `move()` accepts crouch flag and adjusts speed
- [x] `game.js` update(): Read `Input.isCrouching()` → pass to `player.move()` → override step interval, ray count, ray maxDist for step burst
- [x] `index.html`: Add `#crouch-btn` touch button (bottom-center)
- [x] `css/style.css`: Style `#crouch-btn`
- [x] Level 6 ("The Whisper") grid + enemy data in `levels.js`
- [x] Commit + push

### Files Modified
- `js/input.js`
- `js/entities.js`
- `js/game.js`
- `js/levels.js`
- `index.html`
- `css/style.css`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hold Shift: movement speed ~45% of normal
- [ ] Hold Shift: footstep rays are visibly fewer and shorter
- [ ] PatrolEnemy in Level 6 does NOT react to crouched footsteps at patrol range
- [ ] PatrolEnemy DOES react to normal footsteps at patrol range
- [ ] Mobile crouch button visible and functional
- [ ] Crouch + pulse still works (pulse is always loud)

## Phase 2 — Water Zones
**Status:** ✅ Complete (commit `e65bf1b`)  
**Goal:** `CELL.WATER` tiles cause louder, more frequent splashes and slower movement.  
**Depends on:** Phase 0 complete

### Tasks
- [x] `collision.js` `castRay`: Treat `CELL.WATER` as `CELL.EMPTY` (transparent to rays) — already true; `castRay` only blocks on `=== 1`
- [x] `game.js` update(): Check tile under player each frame. Set `G.playerInWater`.
- [x] `game.js` update(): If `G.playerInWater`, apply water step multipliers; call `Audio.playFootstepWater()`
- [x] `audio.js`: `playFootstepWater()` using `SOUND_CONFIG.footstepWater` — already done in Phase 0
- [x] `renderer.js`: If player in water, draw faint teal radial gradient at player position
- [x] Level 7 ("Flooded") grid + enemy data in `levels.js`
- [x] Commit + push

### Files Modified
- `js/entities.js`
- `js/game.js`
- `js/renderer.js`
- `js/levels.js`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Water tiles do NOT block player movement
- [x] Water tiles do NOT block rays
- [x] Walking on water: step rays are visibly more numerous and frequent
- [x] Walking on water: `playFootstepWater()` plays (different from `playFootstep()`)
- [x] Walking on water: player speed is ~60% of normal
- [x] Crouching in water: both multipliers apply (speed is `0.45 × 0.6 × 150 = 40.5 px/s`)
- [x] Faint teal tint appears at player position when in water

## Phase 3 — Collapsible Walls
**Status:** ✅ Complete (commit `e9be4d4`)  
**Goal:** Pulse rays can destroy `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE` walls, permanently opening paths.  
**Depends on:** Phase 0 complete

### Tasks
- [x] `collision.js` `castRay`: Treat `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE` as `CELL.WALL`
- [x] `collision.js` `resolveWalls`: Also block movement on `CELL.COLLAPSIBLE`
- [x] `game.js` `applyWallHits()`: On hit where `G.grid[row][col] === CELL.COLLAPSIBLE` and pulse energy > 0.3: mutate grid, fire 12-ray burst, call `Audio.playCollapse()`
- [x] `game.js`: `cellType: 'collapsible'` stored on impact objects for renderer
- [x] `audio.js`: `playCollapse()` — already done in Phase 0
- [x] `renderer.js`: warm tan `rgba(200,175,120)` for collapsible wall glints

- [x] Collapsible wall glints are warm tan (distinct from normal white-blue glints)

- [x] `entities.js`: Add `Crusher` class — sinusoidal movement, `revealedAt`
- [x] `game.js` `loadLevel()`: Spawn `Crusher` instances from `def.enemies[]` type `'crusher'`
- [x] `game.js` update(): Call `crusher.update(dt)` for each crusher. Check player bounding box overlap → `die('Crushed.')`.
- [x] `collision.js`: `castRayCrushers()` (AABB slab method) + `circleOverlapsAABB()`
- [x] `game.js` `castFn`: Composites grid DDA and crusher AABB results, returns closest hit
- [x] `renderer.js`: `drawCrushers(crushers, now, px, py)` — orange filled block, hearing-attenuated
- [x] Level 9 ("The Corridor") — crushers at col 10, range 2, periods 9/7/5.5s; entry col 6, exit col 14
- [x] Commit + push
